  In Linux, using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F5 switches your view from the graphical user interface (GUI) to a virtual terminal, specifically tty5 (teletype). This is a text-only console where you can log in and work in text mode. Linux systems typically have multiple virtual terminals accessible via Ctrl+Alt and a function key (F1 through F6 for text consoles, with F7 returning to the GUI). If you press Ctrl+Alt+F5 and your screen goes blank, it could be due to issues with your VGA settings for non-graphical screens
