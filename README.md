  In Linux, using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + F5` switches your view from the graphical user interface (GUI) to a virtual terminal, specifically tty5. This is a text-only console where you can login and work in text mode. Linux systems typically have multiple virtual terminals accessible via `Ctrl + Alt` and a function key (`F1` through `F6` for text consoles, with `F7 returning to the GUI`). If you press `Ctrl + Alt + F5` and your screen goes blank, it could be due to issues with your VGA settings for non-graphical screens. Although in some Linux distributions, only `Alt + F7` might be needed. If you're using a more modern Linux distribution, the GUI may be on the first virtual terminal instead of the seventh, so you might need to try different function keys (like `F1` or `F2`) in combination with Ctrl+Alt to get back to the GUI!
