What is a kernel??
==================

A kernel is the core component of an operating system (OS) that manages the operations of the computer and its hardware. It's essentially the bridge between the software running on your computer and its hardware.

Here are some of the key responsibilities of a kernel:

* Resource Management: The kernel manages and allocates the computer's resources (such as CPU time and memory) among the various applications running on it. It also controls communication between processes.
* Memory Management: The kernel has complete control of a computer's memory or RAM. It uses virtual addressing to allocate memory to running processes, ensuring that the memory used by each process doesn't overlap with the memory used by other processes.
* Device Management: The kernel keeps a list of available devices connected to the system and communicates with these devices using their drivers. These drivers are applications that run in kernel mode and allow the OS to communicate with devices like mice, keyboards, and monitors.
* Process Management: The kernel is responsible for creating, scheduling, and terminating processes. It also manages process synchronization and inter-process communication.

The kernel operates in a protected area of memory, known as the kernel space, to prevent user data and kernel data from interfering with each other and causing instability or slowness. This separation also prevents malfunctioning applications from affecting other applications or crashing the entire operating system
